This script will install the following programs/servers:
SabNZBD
SickBeard
CouchPotato
Headphones

It requires you to understand the basic install process and know what the app_path and user will be for each given program.

This script is designed solely to make it quicker and easier for someone who knows what they are doing to “Make it happen”. It is not designed for a first-timer to be able to run and have it running without understanding the programs and their install process/intent.
