This script will install the following programs/servers:
SabNZBD
SickBeard
CouchPotato
Headphones

It requires you to understand the basic install process and know what the app_path and user will be for each given program.

This script is designed solely to make it quicker and easier for someone who knows what they are doing to �Make it happen�. It is not designed for a first-timer to be able to run and have it running without understanding the programs and their install process/intent.

If you like this script and would like to donate, every dollar helps pay the bills around here!

This has only been tested on Ubuntu 12.0.4 and must be run as sudo! If you are able to use on other versions, please open a ticket with the details of your system and any modifications made to the script so that I can document it on the main site and give you credit.
